# Contributing Hour Whiteboard

This is a repo that hosts projects/demos we tackled during Jupyter Server's weekly contributing hour.

List of topics covered:

* [Adding a websocket handler as a server extension](https://github.com/jupyter-server/contributing-hour/tree/2022-04-07)


## How this repo is organized

We create a new branch each week that contains the code we wrote together. We'll add references
to those branches in this README for easy search/access.
