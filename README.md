# Contributing Hour Whiteboard

This is a repo that hosts projects/demos we tackled during Jupyter Server's weekly contributing hour.

## List of topics covered:

* [Adding a websocket handler as a server extension](https://github.com/jupyter-server/contributing-hour/tree/2022-04-07)

## Tips and tricks we've all learned

* `jupyter server --autoreload` runs a Jupyter Server that autoreloads the webapp and all imported Python packages
    when any changes are made to any Python src files in server or extensions.

## How this repo is organized

We create a new branch each week that contains the code we wrote together. We'll add references
to those branches in this README for easy search/access.
